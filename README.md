## What This Does

This Google Apps Script automates 4 common spreadsheet pain points:

| Feature | What it solves |
|---|---|
| **Auto-formatting** | Rows get styled automatically as you type — no manual formatting |
| **Threshold alerts** | Get an email when a value exceeds a limit (e.g. budget overrun) |
| **One-click summary report** | Generates totals, averages, min/max for all numeric columns instantly |
| **Duplicate removal** | Cleans your sheet with one click — keeps first occurrence, removes rest |

---

## How to Run It

1. Open any Google Sheet
2. Go to **Extensions → Apps Script**
3. Paste the contents of `Code.gs`
4. Save and reload your Sheet
5. A new **🔧 Automate** menu appears — click to use

## What I Can Build For You

This demo covers the basics. For your specific use case, I can automate:

- 📥 **Auto-importing data** from forms, emails, or other sheets
- 📤 **Auto-exporting reports** to PDF and sending via email on a schedule
- 🔄 **Two-way sync** between Google Sheets and other tools (CRM, Notion, Airtable)
- 📊 **Custom dashboards** that update automatically
- 🤖 **Any repetitive task** you currently do manually in your spreadsheet

## Timeline & Process

1. You describe the exact task you want automated (15 min call or chat)
2. I estimate the hours and confirm scope
3. I build a working version — you test it
4. Revisions until it works exactly as you need

**Typical turnaround: 1–3 days for most automations.**
